# loan_defaults_project
 
Project summary:  analysis of default among unsecured consumer loans

Steps of the project:

Defining: the brief is to (i) understand who is likely to default, and (ii) 
determine who they should lend to in the future.

Planning: the initial stage includes background reading (e.g. visiting the website of the
client, www.lendingclub.com) and exploratory data analysis of the raw data.
Next is cleaning of the raw data and further analysis and generation of lines of enquiry.
Then a statistical model is built, in order to address the main client question.
Insights are drawn and visualised, with recommendation made.

Understanding: the main dataset is from a U.S. peer-to-peer, 'LendingClub'.
The dataset includes 42,538 unsecured consumer loans made via the site, some of which are 
repaid, charged-off (defaulted), or remain live.

Analysing: manipulation, modelling and validating

Concluding: inferring and communicating findings through reports and visualisations

Implementing: recommendations for real-world implementation, next steps and any limitations to using the findings and outputs.
